## Payment UI Demo
I have currently put some hard coded values to doctor, hospital and total charges. Those data should be taken from relevant services.
at the start, it is shown an success message, because I started this recording soon after add a new value. When the page is refereshed all those success,error validation messages are dissapeared.(Here I didn't refreshed the page before add a new payment)
This is a simple demo. More validations have been done there.
